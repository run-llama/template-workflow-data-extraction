# Data Extraction UI

This is a simple next.js template that builds on the @llamaindex/agent-app ui component library
for showing displaying tables of extracted data.

Ideally run this with `llamactl` in the parent directory (See [README.md](../README.md)),
but you can also run it standalone with `pnpm run dev`, but workflow integrations will not work
